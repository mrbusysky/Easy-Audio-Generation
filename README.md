The installer will take care of whatever is needed. If you face any problems, you can join the friendly [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB) and ask for assistance.

## On Windows:
1. Run the downloaded `Easy-Audio-Generation-Windows.exe` file.
2. Run `Easy-Audio-Generation` once the installation finishes. You can also start from your Start Menu, or from your desktop (if you created a shortcut).

If Windows SmartScreen prevents you from running the program click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

**Tip:** On Windows 10, please install at the top level in your drive, e.g. `C:\EasyAudioGeneration` or `D:\EasyAudioGeneration`. This will avoid a common problem with Windows 10 (file path length limits).

## On Linux/Mac:
1. Unzip/extract the folder `Easy-Audio-Generation` which should be in your downloads folder, unless you changed your default downloads destination.
2. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the `Easy-Audio-Generation` directory.
3. Run `./start.sh` (or `bash start.sh`) in a terminal.

# To remove/uninstall:
Just delete the `EasyDiffusion` folder to uninstall all the downloaded packages.

----

# System Requirements
1. Windows 10/11, or Linux. Experimental support for Mac is coming soon.
2. An NVIDIA graphics card, preferably with 4GB or more of VRAM. If you don't have a compatible graphics card, it'll automatically run in the slower "CPU Mode".
3. Minimum 8 GB of RAM and 25GB of disk space.

You don't need to install or struggle with Python, Anaconda, Docker etc. The installer will take care of whatever is needed.
